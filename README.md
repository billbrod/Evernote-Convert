#Evernote-Convert#

The .bat and .py files in this directory are used to convert notes from evernote (batch export into .html format) into .md format, removing HTML tags, changing the directory the Images are in, and converting it from unicode formatting.

It will not change link targets and it will do its best to maintain formatting, but what exactly will happen is unclear.
